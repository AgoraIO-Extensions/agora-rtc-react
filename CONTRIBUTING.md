# Style Guide

We use an automatic code formatter called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

And we use [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make sure our code better. To make sure our code is follow the rules, we use linter called [ESlint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

It will find and fix some problem in our JS/TS code. Our ESlint rules is [here](.eslintrc).

The last, we use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to checks the code style before commit to git.
